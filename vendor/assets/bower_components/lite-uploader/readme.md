## LiteUploader - HTML5 jQuery File Uploader <sup>v2.1.2</sup>

This is a small jQuery plugin (featured in [this jQuery plugin top 10](http://tekbrand.com/jquery/10-best-jquery-file-upload-plugins)) which utilises the HTML5 features ([File API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/) and [XHR2](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/)) to make uploading files a doddle.

The aim was to see, at its absolute minimum, how little code do you need to make a small, but very usable and easily expandable jQuery upload plugin. With some useful options including basic validation it turns out not many. After minification it is very small in size and is a good choice for any developer who is not so worried about supporting legacy browsers.

### File Error Types

Below is an overview of the error types that can be returned when validating files

* type - when file mime type does not match any mime types supplied in the rule.allowedFileTypes option
* size - when file size is above the size (in bytes) supplied in the rule.maxSize option

### Public API

#### addParam(key, value)

Allows parameters to be added after plugin instantiation

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Default</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>key</td>
        <td>String (required)</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
        <td>name of parameter to be added</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>value</td>
        <td>String (required)</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
        <td>value of parameter to be added</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### cancelUpload()

Allows the upload to be cancelled

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Default</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="4">No parameters</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Gotchas

* make sure your uploads directory is writable (chmod 777)
* make sure your HTML file input has a name attribute as the plugin will not work without it

### Browser Support

The two main HTML5 dependencies for the plugin are the File API and XHR2, and using caniuse ([File API](http://caniuse.com/fileapi), [XHR2](http://caniuse.com/xhr2)) as a reference, if you are using any of the following browser versions you shouldn't have any problem with the code:

* Chrome 13+
* Firefox 4+
* Internet Explorer 10+
* Safari 6+
* Opera 12+

Using [this tool I built](http://browser.burtdev.net) which is based on stats from [gs.statcounter.com](http://gs.statcounter.com), as of March 2014 the browser versions listed above should account for approx 80% of all internet users

### Examples & Tests

There are 3 examples in the `example` directory (using PHP as the server-side language) to help you get on your way and also there is a full suite of Jasmine tests to back the plugin. They can be found in the `tests` directory and run by opening `runner.html`
